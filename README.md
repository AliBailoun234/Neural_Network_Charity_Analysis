### Results
Data PreProcessing
1. The main variable that was considered the target for the model was :IS_SUCCESSFUL column
2. Variables that are considered features for the model were all columns other than IS_SUCCESSFUL
3. Variables that should be removed from the input data (perhaps part of the categorical data) are EIN and NAME

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
